Automated Timetable Generation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
Project Overview:
Timetable generation is a classical Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where the goal
is to assign lectures, rooms, professors, and time slots in a way that satisfies a set of
hard and soft constraints.
Students will design a dynamic timetable generator for their CSIT department, using
data from an Excel sheet or a database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) as input. The system
should automatically construct a feasible timetable that meets all defined constraints.

Project Objectives:
1. Model timetable generation as a CSP problem — defining variables, domains,
and constraints.
2. Develop a solver that produces valid timetables satisfying all constraints.
3. Get you initial data from CSIT time table for Level 1,2,3,4
4. Use a dynamic dataset (database or Excel preferred).
5. Provide user interfaces to update data and regenerate timetables.
6. Evaluate performance (e.g., number of constraint violations, generation time).

CSP Formulation:
Variables:
Each variable represents a lecture or class session.
 Example: Lecture(CourseID, SectionID)
 Each variable’s domain = available time slots × available rooms × available
instructors.
Domains:
 Time slots: e.g., Mon 9 - 10:30, Mon 10:45 – 12:15, ...

 Rooms: Lab1, Lab2, Room101, etc.
 Instructors: Faculty members teaching the courses.
Constraints:
Hard Constraints (must not be violated):
1. No professor can teach more than one class at the same time.
2. No room can host more than one class at the same time.
3. Each course section must have all required lectures per week.
4. Room type must match course type (lab → practical, classroom → lecture).
Soft Constraints (preferred but flexible):
1. Avoid gaps for students
2. Avoid early morning or late evening slots.
3. Avoid scheduling the same instructor in consecutive distant rooms.
4. Distribute classes evenly across the week.

Dataset Description:
Students can generate or extract data from the existing CSIT department timetable and
share between them to find best input format .
Data tables (or Excel sheets):
1. Courses: CourseID, CourseName, Credits, Type (Lecture/Lab)
2. Instructors: InstructorID, Name, PreferredSlots, QualifiedCourses
3. Rooms: RoomID, Type (Lab/Lecture), Capacity
4. TimeSlots: Day, StartTime, EndTime
5. Sections: SectionID, Semester, StudentCount

## 📁 Project Structure

| Phase | Focus Area | Key Output                   |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1     | Parser     | Level mapping & validation   |
| 2     | Models     | Core scheduling entities     |
| 3     | Solver     | Working backtracking engine  |
| 4     | Testing    | Validation of each subsystem |
| 5     | Interface  | CLI & user-facing tools      |
| 6     | Output     | Exports & summary reports    |

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Load and parse course levels correctly
- Generate valid timetables for each level
- Avoid scheduling conflicts
- Export results in readable format

---

## ⚙️ Hard Constraints

- **No instructor double-booking**
- **No room double-booking**
- **Room type matches course type**
- **Level-appropriate time slots**

---

## 🔧 Development Order

1. Course level parser implementation
2. Basic scheduling components
3. Solver implementation
4. Testing and validation
5. Interface development
6. Output generation
